BE PREPARED words and music by Tom Lehrer Be prepared! That's the Boy Scouts' marching song. Be prepared! As through life you march along. Be prepared to hold your liquor pretty well, Don't write naughty words on walls if you can't spell. Be prepared! To hide that pack of cigarettes. Don't make book, If you cannot cover bets. Keep those reefers hidden where you're sure That they will not be found And be careful not to smoke them When the scoutmaster's around, For he only will insist that they be shared. Be prepared! Be prepared! That's the Boy Scouts' solemn creed. Be prepared! And be clean in word and deed. Don't solicit for your sister, that's not nice, Unless you 
get a good percentage of her price. Be prepared! And be careful not to do Your good deeds When there's no one watching you. If you're looking for adventure Of a new and different kind, And you come across a Girl Scout Who is similarly inclined, Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared. Be prepared!
