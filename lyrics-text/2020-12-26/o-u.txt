0-U (The Hound Song) (from The Electric Company) words by Tom Lehrer music: "Caro Nome" from Rigoletto, by Giuseppe Verdi -(public domain) I'm a very quiet hound. I don't bark or run around. I just lie here on the ground, With my head upon this mound. No one knows where I can be found. If they knew, then they'd be bound To come and take me to the pound. That's why I don't dare make a sound.
