I CAN'T THINK WHY based on King Gama's Song from Princess Ida by GIibert & Sullivan revised lyrics by Tom Lehrer (2001) If you give me your attention, I will tell you what I am. I'm a genuine philanthropist --all other kinds are sham. Each little fault of grammar and each social defect In my erring fellow-creatures I endeavor to correct. To all of their deficiencies I Â·open people's eyes, And little plans to decimate their egos I devise. I do all the good I can do from the moment I awake, Yet many people say that I am rather hard to take. And I can't think why! To compliments excessive I've a withering reply, And vanity I always do my best to mortify. A charitable action I can skillfully dissect. A motive that's ulterior I'm happy to detect. If someone does admit a fault, I nonetheless insist On calling his attention to the ones he may have missed. I have a gift for crushing repartee, I must admit, But nobody appreciates the brilliance of my wit. And I can't think why! Although I am opinionated, no one should object. How fortunate I am that my opinions are correct! I point out people's weaknesses before they leave the room. I enjoy correcting people who say "who" instead of "whom." I always say whatever's on my mind, that's very true. I can tell a person's age in half a minute ---and I do. And yet no matter how I try to benefit mankind, Still everybody says that I'm a pain in the behind. And I can't think why!
