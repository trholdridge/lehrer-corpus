WHO'S NEXT? words and music by Tom Lehrer First we got the bomb and that was good, 'Cause we love peace and motherhood. Then Russia got the bomb, but that's O.K., 'Cause the balance of power's maintained that way! Who's next? France got the bomb, but don't you grieve, 'Cause they're on our side (I believe). China got the bomb, but have no fears; They can't wipe us out for at least five years! Who's next? Japan will have it own device, Transistorized at half the price.(*) South Africa wants two, that's right: One for the black and one for the white! Who's next? Egypt's gonna get one, too, Just to use on you know who. So Israel's getting tense, Wants one in self defense. "The Lord's our shepherd," says the psalm, But just in case ---we better get a bomb! Who's next? Luxembourg is next to go And ---who knows ---maybe Monaco. We'll try to stay serene and calm When Alabama gets the bomb! Who's next, who's next, who's next? Who's next? (*) This couplet was originally (until 1968): Then Indonesia claimed that they Were gonna get one any day.
