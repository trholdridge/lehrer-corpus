WE'RE TALKIN' ALGEBRA words and music by Tom Lehrer commissioned by Academic Systems in Mountain View, CA [Note: The verses are to be recited to a quasi-rap beat.] Part I: Polvnomials, rational functions. and theory of equations Polynomials and rational functions, coefficients, Linear factors and quadratics and pure imaginaries, Partial fraction decomposition, And synthetic division, multiplicity of roots, And complex conjugates. (What?) I said "complex conjugates"! (WHAT??) REFRAIN (sung): We're talkin' algebra, Part II: Conic sections What we're doin' here is algebra. Try a little bit and Wow! You are gonna wonder how Did you ever get along without it up to now. It's a
lgebra, Get yourself a little a
lgebra. You are really gonna be amazed at all that it c
an do for you. (Who, me?) Yes, you! Hyperbolas and circles and ellipses and parabolas And diameters and radii and axes of symmetry And sections of the cone and completion of the square And directrices and intercepts and vertices and foci And asymptotes. (What?) I said "asymptotes"! (WHAT??) REFRAIN (sung) Part Ill: Matrices and determinants Linear simultaneous equations and solutions, Using coefficient matrices and quotients of determinants, And inconsistent systems, elementary operations, Using Cramer's rule and Gaussian elimination, And cofactors. (What?) I said "cofactors"! (WHAT??) REFRAIN (sung) Part IV: Mathematical induction, sequences. and counting Geometric sequences and infinite series, Permutations, combinations, and the sigma notation, Mathematical induction, arithmetical progression, And binomial expansion and the Pascal triangle, And factorials. (Huh?) I said "factorials"! (HUH??) REFRAIN (sung) {On the recording the lines "Who, me?", "What?", and "Huh?" were spoken by Edward Landesman.J
