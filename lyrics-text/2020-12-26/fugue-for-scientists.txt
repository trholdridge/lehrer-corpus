FUGUE FOR SCIENTISTS words by Tom Lehrer music: "Fugue for Tinhorns" by Frank Loesser, from Guys and Dolls MATH: PHYSICS: I'd like to say right out 
That math's a 
thing, no doubt, The other sciences would be lost without It's true, it's true Albert Einstein says it's true And if Einstein says it's true, it's true, it's true. But as a scientist I really must insist That it is physics that ought to head the list That's right, that's right [Stephen Hawking] says that's right [originally Professor Oldenberg) And if [Hawking] says that's right, that's right, that's right. CHEMISTRY: But, boys, I can not see How you can not agree That the most important is chemistry Oh yes, oh yes [President Conant] says oh yes And if [Conant] says oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. MA TH: But after all is said Math is way ahead PHYSICS: Who else can do research while lying in bed? It's true, etc. The atom bomb's a 
bit Of genius, you'll admit Just think of all the people we've killed with it That's right, etc. CHEMISTRY: But listen here to me Where would your A-bombs be If it were not for little old chemistry? Oh yes, etc. MATH: But let me make the point PHYSICS: There's things that should be loint Besides inventing ways to blow up the joint It's true, etc. I really can't condemn The guys who take up chem For learning how to cook may appeal to them That's right, etc. CHEMISTRY: But you can be sure, chum That in the years to come We are the guys you're gonna be hearin' from MATH: Math!! PHYSICS: Physics! CHEMISTRY: Chemistry! ALL: That's us!
