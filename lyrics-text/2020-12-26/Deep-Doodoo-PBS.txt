DEEP DOODOO
 words and music by Tom Lehrer
 written for the PBS special ÒListen Up!Ó (1992)
 sung by Keith Carradine
 1. When the classroomÕs packed, and the libraryÕs shut,
     And evÕry year thereÕs a budget cut,
  And the textbooks only keep on gettinÕ dumber,
     When 
standards seem to be on the skids,
     And it gets so even the 
kids
 have kids,
  And evÕryone can hardly wait till summer 
--------   Then weÕre in deep doodoo,
   Deep, deep doodoo.
   What can folks like me and you do
   When the doodoo
   Gets so deep? ......
.. and gettinÕ deeper ........
  2. When we canÕt compete with the Japanese,
     Or the Portuguese, or the chimpanzees,
  And evÕrybody plays by diffÕrent rules,
     It ainÕt a question of when or whether,
     Any fool can put two and two together,
  Unless t
hey took new math at one of our schools.
   Yes, weÕre in deep doodoo,
   Deep, deep doodoo.
   God knows thereÕs plenty 
to do
   When the doodoo
   Gets so deep ........ and gettinÕ deeper .......
  3. When some schools feel like combat sectors,
     With guns and gangs and metal detectors
  (Remember how we felt guilty just ÒplayinÕ hookyÓ?)
     When the school is broke, and homeworkÕs a joke,
     And the kids do booze or grass or coke,
  WeÕve come a long way from chocÕlate milk and a cookie.
   And
 weÕre in deep doodoo,
   Deep, deep doodoo,
   And itÕs gonna take more than voodoo
   ÔCause the doodoo
   Is so deep ........ and gettinÕ deeper .......
  4. People keep givinÕ me the same old pitch:
     ÒIf youÕre so smart, why ainÕt you rich?Ó
     IÕve hea
rd that all my life, and I know it by heart.
     And to tell the truth, I wish I knew,
     But, America, 
IÕm
 askinÕ 
you
:     If youÕre so rich......why ainÕt you smart?
   Yes, weÕre in deep doodoo,
   Deep, deep doodoo.
   So ask yourself what can you do
   When the doodoo
   Gets so deep.
  ItÕs time to look and time to leap,
  ThereÕs promises weÕve got to keep,
  And as you sow, so shall you reap,
  But whatever it is, it wonÕt be cheap,
  ÔCause the doo.....doo.....is.....so.....deep!
