Author™s note:
  The Gallery 
(1947) was a highly successful novel by John Horne 
  Burns, based on his experiences in the American Army of Occu
-  pation
 in Naples in 1944.
  In 1951 I and a fellow graduate student at Harvard, Eloise Knapp, 
  briefly considered writing a musical based on the book.
  The project 
  was soon abandoned.
 This is
 one of the few surviving fragments of the 
 prospective score.
  It was intended to be
 sung
 by a group of 
scugnizzi 
  (Neapolitan street urchins) to an Americn soldier, 
while a nearby 
 Neapolitan singer sings ﬂO Sole Mioﬂ.
  HEY, JOE!
  (The two parts are to be sung simultaneously)
  SCUGNIZZI:
