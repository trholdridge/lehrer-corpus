SCENERY words by Tom Lehrer music by James van Heusen tune: "
Harmony" (from Variety Girl -1947) written for and used in shows at Camp Androscoggin (Enter in front of curtain) If it is not exactly clear Why I'm here, You may think it's part of the plot, But it's not. This song I bring Is just a silly thing, Which I will only sing, You see, To give them time to change the scenery. Scenery, scenery, The only reason that there is for this here song Is to help the guys along. (turning upstage) {all backstage yell:) (to audience) Tell us now, are you ready for us? NO! Well, in that case, I will sing another chorus. If you should ask me why this song Is so long, All I can say is just that I'm Killing time. As you must know, I didn't write this show, And so you mustn't go Blaming me. I'm here to let them change the scenery. Scenery, scenery, And if you think this song is silly as can be, I admit that I agree. ' (turning upstage) Tell us now, are you ready for us? (all backstage yell:) YES! (to audience) Well, in that case, you are spared another chorus. (Exit) Note: Can be done as a solo or by a small group (changing "I" to "we," etc.) A dance interlude may be inserted if the song still isn't long enough to accommodate the scene change.
