WERNHER VON BRAUN words & music by Tom Lehrer Gather 'round while I sing you of Wernher von Braun A man whose allegiance Is ruled by expedience Call him a Nazi, he won't even frown "Nazi, Schmazi!" says Wernher von Braun. Don't say that he's hypocritical Say rather that he's apolitical "Once the rockets are up, who cares where 
they come down? That's not my department!" says Wernher von Braun. Some have harsh words for this man of renown But some think our attitude Should be one of gratitude _Like the widows and cripples in old London 
town Who owe their large pensions to Wernher von Braun. You too may be a big hero Once you've learned to count backwards to zero "In German, oder Englisch, I know how to count down Und I'm learning Chinese!" says Wernher von Braun.
