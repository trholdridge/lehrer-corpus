DON'T MAJOR IN PHYSICS words by Tom Lehrer music: "The Trouble with Women" by Kurt Weill (from One Touch of Venus) (1st student) Oh, I once loved a sweet Physics student, The loveliest girl one could find, But I tried to get close and I cudent, For she said that she wasn't "that kind." More often a king weds a commoner Than a physicist makes a housewife, For they only are versed in phenomener That have nothing to do with real life. (Chorus) So don't ever major in Physics, Try History, English, or Gov, For you may learn a lot about science, But you won't learn a thing about love. (2nd student) Oh, I too loved a young Physics major, She was pretty and healthy and pure, But I wouldn't take one now on a wager, For they all are like her, I am sure. She didn't like couches or hammocks Or walks in the moonlight for two. All she thought of was thermodynammocks, So what, tell me what, could I do? (Chorus) (3rd student) Now I have the opposite status: I like physics and my girl does not. I tried showing her my apparatus, But a blank smile was all that I got. She asked me why I was in Physics, And advised me to transfer to Ee, And whenever I tried to talk Physics, All she wanted to do was to neckl (ugh!) (Chorus)
