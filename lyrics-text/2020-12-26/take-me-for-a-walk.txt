TAKE ME FOR A WALK (written for the aborted revision of Park) Trio -Sara {daughter), Austin (father), Elizabeth (mother] --[or quartet, including Jamie (son)] lyrics by Tom Lehrer (no music written) Take me for a walk That's all I ask of you A simple walk, perhaps a talk, Exchanging points of view An occasional quiet little stroll Rejuvenates the soul Not too energetic Merely peripatetic Millionaires can't measure What a simple pleasure --means. They just don't have a glimmer Riding in their limou --sines. If they got out the lead And tried to walk instead They'd gladly throw their calendars away And say: Just take me for a walk with you To -Day. [alt: Nothing too athletic] Optional: Cancel lunch and hold my calls And hand me down my overalls I'm going for a walk Today. INTERLUDE : A: There surely must be something I can buy you [mostly spoken] With which to ply you And satisfy you A trip to Tahiti? S: Forget it, sweetie. A: A new Ferrari? E: [yawns] Terribly sorry. A: A color TV? A Ph.D.? A 
nightingale? The Holy Grail? Well, how about a diamond ring Or anything I possess? S,E: Sir, what do you take us for? A: A walk, I guess. S,E: That's more like it! Take me for a walk Take a walk with me We'll traipse along, And sing a song, As jaunty as can be. -2-An adventurous early morning hike Is what I'd really like No destination And not much perspiration We could simply mosey To a green and cozy --glen Savor the aroma Till we head for home a --gain. S,E: We could be climbing a peak with a stick and a pack A: Spending a week with a crick in my back But nevertheless I'll join you, if I may --S,E: Okay! (Alternating:) We can amble along Or shamble along Or toddle along Or waddle along Or swagger along Or stagger along Our way --Hey! Please take me for a walk with you To-Day.
