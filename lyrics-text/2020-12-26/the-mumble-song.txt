THE MUMBLE SONG (as performed on The Electric Company) words & music by Tom Lehrer Lead vocal: Skip Hinnant Scene: Skip unsuccessfully trying to tell his girlfriend (Judy Graubart), at various stages in their lives, how he feels about her. They get older in successive verses. [Skip] My hands begin to fumble. My stomach starts to rumble. But what really makes me grumble Is my cookies start to crumble. All I can do is mumble, "I. .. luh ... yoo ... " My feet begin to stumble. I'm just about to tumble. My thoughts are all a-jumble, And my bee forgets to bumble. All I can do is mumble, "Luv yoommm ... " You make me feel so, mmm, hummmble, That I stumble, tumble, jumble, bumble, Fumble, rumble, grumble, crumble, [Trying to speak, but still incoherent] "Ah lub yoom .. " [Judy] What? [Skip] I said, "Ah luv ... yoommm ... " [Judy] What? [Skip] Pay attention. I said, "I luuuvvv ... yoooo." [Judy] Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?"
