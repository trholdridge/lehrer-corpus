TE AMO words and music by Tom Lehrer (with thanks to Munro Edmonson) HE: Te amo, vida de mi vida, Te amo con todo mi coraz6n. Par ti yo muero, mi querida, Dejame decirte mi pasi6n. SHE: The moon is high above, And I'm in the mood for love, And I just love the song he is playing, The night is so romantic, But it's driving me just frantic, Cause I don't understand a word he's saying. My troubles all might vanish If I knew a little Spanish, But I'm afraid it's only Greek to me. And yet I wish I knew Just what the guy would do If I should say "Si, Si." HE: Mi amor, Un favor Yo te pido. Mi amor, Un favor SHE: I think he said "amor." Un besito de contestaci6n. (Alt.: Yo te pido solamente que me envfes tu un beso del balc6n.) Te amo, vida de mi vida. Teamo con todo mi coraz6n. Par tf yo muero, mi querida. Dejame decirte mf pasi6n. Si, Si? Si, Si? Ella dice "Si, Si"! I've heard that word before. I'm almo~t sure that love Is what he's thinking of. There he goes again! The moon 
is high above, And I'm in the mood for love, And I just love the song that he's playing. The night is so romantic, But it's driving me just frantic, 'Cause I don't understand a word he's saying. My troubles all might vanish If I knew a l
ittle Spanish, But I'm afraid it's only Greek to me. And yet I wish I knew Just what the guy would do, If I should say "Si, Si." Si, Si! Si, Si! So we shall see, Si, Si!
