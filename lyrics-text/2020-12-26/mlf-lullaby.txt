MLFLULLABY words and music by Tom Lehrer Sleep, baby, sleep, in peace may you slumber, No danger 
lurks, your sleep to encumber. We've got the missiles, peace to determfoe, And one of the fingers on the button will be German. Why shouldn't they have nuclear warheads? England says no, but they all are soreheads. I say a bygone should be a bygone, Let's make peace the way we did in Stanleyville and Saigon. Once all the Germans were warlike and mean, But that couldn't happen again. We taught them a lesson in 1918 And they've hardly bothered us since then. So, sleep well, my darling, the sandman can linger. We know our buddies won't give us the finger. Heil -hail -the W ehrmacht ---I mean the Bundeswehr ---Hail to our loyal ally! M.L.F. Will scare Brezhnev. I hope he is half as scared as I!
