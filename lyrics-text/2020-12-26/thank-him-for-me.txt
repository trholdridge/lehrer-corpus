THANK HIM FOR ME WORDS BY TOM LEHRER Once upon a timeless past Someone with a faceless name Opened a door for you, Opened much more for you. Maybe that was miles ago, But he is with you just the same. He helped you to be What you are to me Today. So now it's me, and now it's you, and now it's us But it didn't, No, it didn't have to be, And so when you see him, If you ever see him, Thank him for me. Miracles don't just appear fully grown. They start off as wonders That have to be tended And nourished and mended Until they are splendid Enough to go out on their own. And somewhere in the timeless past 
Is someone to be grateful to, Like yesterday's vine That made today's wine. Maybe he has someone now Who's happy that a part of you Is somehow still his, Wherever he is Today. And now it's me, and now it's you, and now it's us. And it didn't, No, it didn't have to be, And so when you see him, If you ever see him, Thank him for me. (There have been two settings for these lyrics, one by TL and one by Michael Gould.)
