SMUT· words and music by Tom Lehrer Smut! Give me smut and nothing but! A dirty novel I can't shut If it's uncut And unsubt-le. I've never quibbled If it was ribald. I would devour Where others merely nibbled. As the judge remarked the day that he acquitted my Aunt Hortense, "To be smut It must be ut-Terly without redeeming social importense." Por-Nographic pictures I adore. Indecent magazines galore, I like them more If they're hardcore. Bring on the obscene movies, murals, postcards, neckties, samplers, stained glass windows, tattoos, anything! More, more, I'm still not satisfied! Stories of tortures Used by debauchers Lurid, licentious and vile, Make me smile. Novels that pander To my taste for candor Give me a pleasure sublime. Let's face it, I love slime! All books can be indecent books, Though recent books are bolder. For filth, I'm glad to say, Is in the mind of the beholder. When correctly viewed, Everything is lewd. I could tell you things about Peter Pan, And the Wizard of Oz ---There's a dirty old man! I thrill To any book like Fanny Hill, And I suppose I always will, If it is swill And really fil-thy. Who needs a hobby like tennis or philately? I've got a hobby: rereading Lady Chatterley. But now they're trying to take it all away (*) from us unless We take a stand, and hand in hand We fight for freedom of the·press. · In other words: Smut! (I love it.) The adventures of a slut. Oh, I'm a market they can't glut. I don't know what Compares with smut. Hip, hip, hooray! Let's hear it foflhe Supreme Court! Don't let them take it away! (*) These three lines were replaced in Tomfoolery by: I love the Bill of Rights with all the fervor I possess, And when I pray, I always say, "Thank God for freedom of the press".
