SOLONG,MOM words and music by Tom Lehrer So long, Mom, I'm off to drop the bomb, So don't wait up for me. But while you swelter Down there in your shelter, You can see me On your TV. While we're attacking frontally, Watch Brinkally and Huntally, Describing contrapuntally The cities we have lost. No need for you to miss a minute Of the agonizing holocaust. Little Johnny Jones he was a U.S. pilot, And no shrinking vi'let was he. He was mighty proud when World War Three was declared. He wasn't scared, No siree! And this is what he said on His way to armageddon: So long, Mom, I'm off to drop the bomb, So don't wait up for me. But though I may roam, I'll come back to my home, Although it may be A pile of debris. Remember, Mommy, I'm off to get a Commie, So send me a salami, And try to smile somehow. I'll look for you when the war is over An hour and a half from now
