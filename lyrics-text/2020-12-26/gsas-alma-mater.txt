GSAS ALMA MATER words by Tom Lehrer music: "Goofus" by Wayne King & William Harold Though we end up as professors or selling appliances We will not forget throughout 
all life's alliances The dear Graduate School of Arts and of Sciences No-sir-reel Though there is hardly a one here who knows if he Will be an M.A. or a Doctor of PhilQsophy Nevertheless GSAS We will always be true to thee! Though you have no football team And no cheers that we can scream Yet as strange as it may seem We still love you! Each alumnus may meet with success or adversity But whether he feels he should bless it or curse it, he Admits it's the best part 
of this university Yes-sir-ree! Far from the real world's corruption and connivery We love ev'ry one of your great tow'rs of ivory And we confess GSAS, We will always be true to thee!
