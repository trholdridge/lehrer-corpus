 THE NIGHT I APPEARED AS MACBETH 
  lyrics and music by William Hargreaves (1922) 
  revised lyrics (in italics) by Tom Lehrer (1982)   
 For most of my life, I confess it, 
I™ve had no desire for the stage, 

But one fateful night 
I was asked to recite, 
And Gadzooks, I was quickly the rage.  

Soon I knew that Macbeth was the one role 
That would certainly make my career, 
And my friends said,  ﬁOf course you must do it, 
So long as you don™t do it here.ﬂ 
So I went, hired a hall, 

And gave a performance that shattered them all. 
  I acted so tragic 

 The house rose like magic, 
 The audience yelled, ﬁYou™re sublime!ﬂ 
 They made me a present 

 Of Mornington Crescent. 
 They threw it one brick at a time. 
 The crowd filled the air with their chatter and clatter 
 And quite an assortment of vegetable matter. 
 They jeered, 
 And they sneered, 

 Though they cheered at the scene of my death. 
 I got no hosannas, 
 Just eggs and bananas, 

 The night I appeared as Macbeth. 
 The play, though ascribed to Bill Shakespeare, 
To me lacked both polish and tone, 
So I threw in some bits 

From some popular hits 
And a few comic lines of my own. 
Unfortunately, the director 

Decided the play was too long, 
So he forced me to cut out my tap-dance 
And half of my second-act song. 

All that work, gone to waste, 
Ah, but what can you do with a man with no taste?
  
 I acted so tragic, 
 The house rose like magic, 
 They wished David Garrick could see. 

 But he™s in the Abbey 
 Then someone quite shabby 
 Suggested that™s where 
I should be. 
 They hooted like owls and they whistled like crickets, 
 Especially those who had paid for their tickets. 
 The witches 
 Were in stitches, 
 And the cast was soon quite out of breath. 

 I cried, ﬁLay on, MacDuff!ﬂ 
 They cried, ﬁLay off, enough!ﬂ 
 The night I appeared as Macbeth.
