_) POST-THANKSGIVING HYMN words by Tom Lehrer tune: "We Gather Together" (trad. Dutch) written for and used 
on the November 25, 1989, broadcast of Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company of the Air We gathered together to ask the Lord's blessing For turkey and dressing And cranberry sauce. It was slightly distressing, But now we're convalescing, So sing praises to his name, And -remember to floss. Our nearest and dearest, we don't mind confessing. It's sort of depressing To have them so near. Our feelings suppressing, We concentrate on tressing, (alt We're sweetly acquiescing) As loudly we proclaim That we're glad they were here. We gathered together and got the Lord's blessing. (Of course we're just guessing, 'Cause how can you tell?) Our stomachs are bloating, Our kidneys nearly floating, Hellos are very nice, But goodbyes can be swell. published in SING OUT magazine -September 2002
