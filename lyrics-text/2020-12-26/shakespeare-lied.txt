SHAKESPEARE LIED (from How Now, Dow Jones (1968)) original lyrics by Carolyn Leigh, original music by Elmer Bernstein, adapted by Tom Lehrer A: Oh, God, I can't live without him! I'll die! B: Die from love? A: People have. B: Aah! You've been reading too many books. Listen! B: Shakespeare lied. When Juliet died, Romeo didn't take poison just because he'd lost his bride. A: What did he do? B: He got over it. He went back to Junior High, and he got over it. And so will you. You'll get over it. A: So Romeo got himself a life, But then, there's Othello, he murdered his wife! B: But Shakespeare lied. Othello may have cried, But he never strangled Desdemona 'cause he thought she lied. A: What did he do? B: He got over it. She found the handkerchief, and he got over it. And so will you. You'll get over it. Just bear in mind that Shakespeare lied. A: Okay, how about Cleopatra? B: You recall that asp In Cleopatra's grasp, Well, she didn't yell "O, Antony'' and gasp her final gasp. A: You're putting me on! B: No! None the worse from it She even made a stunning snakeskin purse from it. And as for you ---A: ]know! I'll get over it. B: You'll get over it, A: Okay, take Hamlet, he's a better test, 'Cause there was a guy who was really depressed. B: But Shakespeare lied. When all those people died, Hamlet didn't just mope around and think of suicide. A: What did he do? Don't tell me BOTH: He got over it. B: Right! He got himself some Prozac and got over it. And so will you. You'll get over it. A: I'll get over it. B: Love isn't fatal, as a rule, Forget all that stuff you learned in school, And bear in mind, whatever you decide That Shake ----A: So he made a mistake, Speare ---And I'm happy to hear he BOTH: Lied!
