SILENT E from The Electric Company words and music by Tom Lehrer Who can turn a can into a cane? Who can turn a pan into a pane? It's not too hard to see It's Silent E Who can turn a cub into a cube? Who can tum a tub into a tube? It's elementary For Silent E He took a pin and turned it into pine He took a twin and turned him into twine Who can turn a cap into a cape? Who can tum a tap into a tape? A little glob becomes a globe instantly If you just add Silent E He turned a dam -Alikazam ! -into a dame But my friend Sam stayed just the same Who can turn a man into a mane? Who can turn a van into a vane? A little hug becomes huge instantly Don't add W, don't add X, and don't add Y or Z, Just add Silent E
