squared And Tis 2 n times the square root of Lover g. STUDENT: I try my level best, And I cram for ev'ry test, And I do all my work without delaying. I'm certainly not lazy, But I think I'll soon go crazy, 'Cause I don't understand a word he's saying. I hope they overlook this course, For why I ever took this course Will always be a mystery to me.

ish I 
knew Just what the dean will do If I don't get a C. PROFESSOR: The force is mass Times acceleration. Yes, the force is the mass Times the acceleration, or more precisely, the time derivative of the linear momentum. s is one half g t

squared And T is 2 
n times the square root of L over g. Overg Over g Square root of L by g. STUDENT: I think he said the force, I know that word, of course, It's all becoming clear, But it's too late, I fear. There he goes again! I try my level best, and I cram for ev'ry test, I'm certainly not lazy, but I think I'll soon go crazy, 'Cause I don't understand a word he's saying. I hope they overlook this course, For why I ever took this course Will always be a mystery to me. But still I wish I knew just what the dean will do If I don't get a C. aC aC If I don't get a C
