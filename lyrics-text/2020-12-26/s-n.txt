One handkerchief'II Just never suffice. But, brother, watch out for the breeze When I sneeze --( sneeze --sneeze --sneeze) I love to sniff --( sniff) [spoken] Just take a whiff --(sniff) I also like snarling, it feels good to me.

But I'm even happier if I can sniff --(sniff) And sneeze --(sneeze) I love to snore --( snore) [spoken] It's more like a roar --(snore) I lik~ to snooze, I like resting my head. I take off my shoes, And I snuggle in bed.

But much more than any of these I love to snore .... and to sniff .... and to sneeze.
