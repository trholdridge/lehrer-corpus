A LITER AND A GRAM words by Tom Lehrer music by Frank Laesser ("A Bushel and a Peck" from Guys and Dolls) I love you a liter and a gram A liter and a gram, and it's crazy that I am A meter and a yard and a newton and a watt A newton and a watt, and I wanna know a lot About you About you (Chorus) A meter and a liter Nothin' could be sweeter 'Cause I love you a liter and a gram And it's crazy that I am for you. I love you a poundal and a dyne A poundal and a dyne, and I wanna make you mine A footpound and an erg and a joule and a calorie A joule and a calorie, and I wanna spend my salary On you On you (Chorus) Centigrades and Fahrenheits You lift me up to darin' heights 'Cause I love you a poundal and a dyne And I wanna make you mine, I do.
