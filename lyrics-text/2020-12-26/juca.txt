JUCA music and Portuguese lyrics by Chico Buarque English lyrics by Tom Lehrer Juca foi autuado em flagrante Como meliante Pois sambava hem diante Da janela de Maria Bern no meio da alegria A noite virou dia 0 seu luar de prata Virou chuva fria A sua serenata Nao acordou Maria. Juca ficou desapontado Declarou ao delegado Nao saber se amor e crime Ou se samba e pecado En legitima defesa Batucou assim na mesa 0 delegado e bamba Na delegacia Mas nunca fez samba N unca viu Maria [repeat last four lines] Juca was arrested for dancing, It was part of his romancing, Serenading his Maria, Who was finding it entrancing. Two policemen, reconnoitering, Decided he was loitering. Outside the shops Along that street in Rio, He tried to get the cops To make the act a trio. Juca was a little disgusted When they took him into custod-y --He said, "Now just forÂ· dancing Can a guy get busted?" His defense was very short: He did a samba in the court, And yet the judge said "Guilty! Why, the very idea!" But he hadn't danced in years and never met Maria. Juca said, "It sure would be a great idea If judges learned to dance, And if they met my Maria."
