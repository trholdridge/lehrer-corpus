.~ () WITHOUT ANS (performed by Rita Moreno and Bill Cosby on The Electric Company) words by Tom Lehrer music: "Without a Song'' by Vincent Youmans Without an S --A nest would be a net. Without an S --The west would just be wet. What happiness! That pest could be a pet, Without an S. Without an S --A spin would be a pin. Without an S --Your skin would be your kin. And I confess That sin is really in, Without an S. A spine would then be a pine, And swine would turn to wine, A stick would be a tick. When you were sick, You wouldn't feel sick, You'd only feel ick! Without an S --A slap would be a lap. Without an S --A strap would be a trap. Your hands can't clasp, No, they can only clap, Without an S. A scar would then be a car, A star would turn to tar, A mast would be a mat. Try running fast, You couldn't be fast, You'd only be fat! Without an S --A ship would be a hip. Without an S --A slip would be a lip. When you undress, A strip would be a trip, Without an S.
