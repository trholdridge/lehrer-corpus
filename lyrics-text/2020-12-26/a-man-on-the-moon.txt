(We're Gonna Put) A MAN ON THE MOON words and music by Tom Lehrer (performed on 'That Was the Week that Was" on April 27, 1965) We're gonna put a man on the moon ---Gloryosky! Every taxpayer from Florida to Oregon Says that twenty billion dollars is a bar-a-gain. We're gonna put a man on the moon ---Leapin' lizards! So if we can trim the budget, we will trim it, But when it comes to space, the sky's the limit. For floods and fires and famines we can't spare an extra quarter, So up and down the Mississippi folks are treading water, But still there is no doubt That they're proud to be wiped out. It's worth it To put a man on the moon. If we could spare the money, we perhaps could find the answer To why so many people die of heart disease and cancer, But, heck, they're glad to go. It's worth it just to know That the money Will put a man on the moon. But don't complain of empty pockets or empty pantries. Think of all those sexy rockets sitting on their gantries. We're proud of every orbit, And I hope you're doing your bit To help us land there soon. Let's crack down on all tax dodgers So some nut can play Buck Rogers, When we put a man on the moon. Note: The first man on the moon was Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969.
