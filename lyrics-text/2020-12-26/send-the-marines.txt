SEND THE MARINES words and music by Tom Lehrer When someone makes a move Of which we don't approve, Who is it that always intervenes? U.N. and O.A.S., They have their place, I guess, But first-Send the Marines! We'll send them all we've got, (*) alt: We know that the UN Is helpful now and then John Wayne and Randolph Scott; Remember those exciting fighting scenes? To the shores of Tripoli,(**) But not to Mississippoli, What do we do? We send the Marines! For might makes right, And till they've seen the light, They've got to be protected, All their rights respected, Till somebody we like can be elected. Members of the corps All hate the thought of war. They'd rather kill them off by peaceful means. Stop calling it aggression, Ooh, we hate that expression! We only want the world to know That we support the status quo. They love us everywhere we go, So when in doubt, Send the Marines!
