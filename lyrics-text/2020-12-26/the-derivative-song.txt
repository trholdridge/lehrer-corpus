' / The Derivative Song (dy/dx) 
words by Tom Lehrer music: "There'll Be Some Changes Made" by W. Benton Overstreet (1921) (public domain) You take a function of x and you call it y Take any x-nought that you care to try You make a little change and call it delta x The corresponding change in y is what you find nex' And then you take the quotient and now carefully Send delta x to zero, and I think you'll see That what the limit gives us, if our work all checks, Is what we call dy/dx, It's just dy/dx.
