BABY, IS IT LOVE? (original version) words by Tom Lehrer I see flashing strobes And mirrored globes And stereo merry-go-rounds. A choir sings And a thousand strings Make luxuriant, prurient sounds. You're, like ---beautiful This is real, this is right, this is it! You're, like ---beautiful This is it, but I have to admit Though you're hugging me And there's sunsets and rockets and thunder Something's bugging me And I think of tomorrow and wonder: (Refrain:) Some kind of magic has captured us Thrilled and enraptured us But ---Is this emotion devotion As deep as the ocean, Or what? Was that a tender caress Or only a grope? Baby, Is it love ---Or is it the dope?
