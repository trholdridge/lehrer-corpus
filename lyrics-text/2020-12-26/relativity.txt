RELATIVITY words by Tom Lehrer music: "Personality" by James Van Heusen from the movie The Road to Utopia Optional verse (tune: "Massa's in the Cold Cold Ground") Einstein was the first who stated --He was the first who dared --Mass and energy are related By E equals m c 
squared. When Isaac Newton wrote The laws that we all quote, It's now extremely apparent that he Neglected to consider Relativity. What focused our attention On the fourth dimension? We'd been doing so well with just three. 'Twas Mister Einstein's brain child, Relativity. And who would think And who'd forecast That bodies shrink When they go fast? It makes old Isaac's theory Look w-e-o-ry. And so if you are near When atom bombs appear, And you're reduced to a pile of debris, You'll know it's largely due to Relativity. In The Physical Revue this song was preceded by the following dialogue: Student: May I ask you a question, sir? Professor: Certainly Student: Well, would you say that a relativistic approach to the non-synthetic aspects of Newtonian mechanics is useful in formulating a comprehensive ontology for the metaphysical ramifications of these essentially empirical manifestations? Professor: Ummmm .... No! Student: Well, what would you say? Professor: I would say that a relativistic approach to the non-synthetic aspects of Newtonian mechanics is not useful in formulating a comprehensive ontology for the metaphysical ramifications of these essentially empirical manifestations. But I do think this course underestimates the importance of relativity, and I would like you to hear a few words in its behalf.
