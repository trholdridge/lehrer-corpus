(I'm Spending) HANUKKAH IN SANTA MONICA words and music by Tom Lehrer I'm spending Hanukkah In Santa Monica. Wearing sandals, Lighting candles By the sea. I spent Shevuos In East St. Louis, A charming spot 
But clearly not The spot for me. Those Eastern winters, I can't endure 'em, So ev'ry year I pack my gear And come out here Till Purim. Rosh Hashonah I spend in Arizonah, And Yorn Kippuh [Southern accent] Way down in Mississippuh, But in December there's just one place for me. Amid the California flora I'll be lighting my menorah, Like a baby in his cradle I'll be playing with my dreidel, Here's to Judas Maccabeus, Boy, if he could only see us, Spending Hanukkah In Santa Monica By the sea.
